Tutorial
--------

Welcome to the tutorial of Qrisp! This page will help you get started by providing step-by-step instructions and examples. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced quantum programmer, this tutorial provides a helping hand exploring the fundamentals of the framework and make you familiar with its syntax and features.

To gradually qrispify your programming game you will start with the basics and gradually build your qrispertoire to more advanced features like automatic :ref:`recomputation <recomputation>`. We've structured the tutorial in a way that is easy to follow:

- in :ref:`Getting familiar with Qrisp <Qrisp101>` you will, well, get familiar with Qrisp. After being stimulated to replace thinking with quantum cirtuits with thinking with **QuantumVariables**, you'll learn to solve a quadratic equation using **Grover's algorithm** and get acquainted with **Quantum Phase Estimation**. A real quantum leap!

- :ref:`QAOA implementation and QAOAProblem <QAOA101>` will break down the **theory** behind this promising algorithm before implementing it for the **MaxCut** problem and the **graph coloring** problem. The tutorial might or might not involve **crayons**. I know exactly what you're thinking right now: "Crayons in a tutorial? Thatâ€™s pretty neat!".

- :ref:`Solving the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) <tsp>` is again pretty self explanatory - you'll set up a **superposition** of all routes, **evaluate** route distance, and create a **Grover's oracle** to eventually evaluate it. What a trip!

Along the way, we'll introduce you to important concepts and techniques that you'll need to know in order to write highly efficient algorithms in Qrisp.
We encourage you to follow along with the examples and try out the code for yourself. Don't worry if you make mistakes or don't understand something right away - programming is a process of learning and experimentation, and it takes time to become proficient.

By the end of this tutorial, you'll have a solid foundation of our high-level framork and be ready to tackle more complex projects. So let's get **started**!
